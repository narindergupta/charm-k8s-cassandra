      The size of the JVM's young generation in the heap. If you

      Name of the Cassandra cluster. This is mainly used to
      prevent machines in one logical cluster from joining
      another. All Cassandra services you wish to cluster together
      must have the same cluster_name. This setting cannot be changed
      after service deployment.

      The rack used by the endpoint_snitch for all units in this

      It defaults to the service name. Cassandra will store replicated
      data in different racks whenever possible.
